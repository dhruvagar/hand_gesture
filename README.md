# hand_gesture
Arduino based project integrated with python
Hey guys, this is my first Arduino project. It is called Gesture based Control of Computer. It uses ultrasonic sensors to detect hand gestures. This project can currently detect 5 different gestures.
1) If I swipe my hand in front of the right sensor, then it performs the function of the right arrow key on my laptop.
2) Similarly, it performs the function of left arrow key if I swipe my hand in front of the left sensor.
3) If I move my hand closer to the right sensor, then it scrolls up.
4) If I move my hand away from the right sensor, then it scrolls down
5) if I swipe my hand in front of both sensors (left to right) then it performs the function of alt+tab key.
I used Python to implement the data gathered by the Arduino. This project has many applications and can be used in our daily lives.
